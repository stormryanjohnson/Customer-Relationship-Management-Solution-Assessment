# Work Sample Test: Build a CRM Solution (Customer Relationship Management)

A CRM is a tool to help sales people manage their interactions with customers. It typically stores all the information related to customers, people, leads and opportunities. Examples of well-known CRMS are Salesforce, Pipedrive, SugarCRM among others.

We would like you to create a CRM application. Use your own initiative and research to decide what capabilities it should offer. Then go ahead and build the application in the Foundry Sandbox. 

We would like you to use the two datasets attached as a basis for the company and person objects.

Our goal is to understand whether you can translate a need into an application. We are not looking for perfection, but rather for effectiveness in solving for the need.
